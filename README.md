# Heart Attack Prediction

After Diving Deep into the realm of Neural Networks and seeing the vast amount of thier possible applications, I was excited to build and train my own Neural Network, I came across an interesting dataset on Kaggle about Heart Attacks.

### Key Achievements:
* Explored the dataset extensively with helpful charts
* Applied Several data transformation and scaling techniques to preprocess the data for training.
* Created Multiple Neural Network architectures and experimented with them to find the best architecture.
* Experimented with different values for the hyperparameters to reach the highest accuracy
* Evaluated these networks based on several metrics
* I eventually reach an accuracy of over 98% on the test set


### In this notebook:
* The dataset is explored with helpful charts that give an initial view on the data
* The data is cleaned and prepared for training
* A neural network is built and trained on the training set
* The results are evaluated based on multiple metrics with their visualizations.
